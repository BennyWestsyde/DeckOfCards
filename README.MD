# Deck Of Cards

This is supposed to be a modular, extensible, and easy to use deck of cards. In the future, I would like to add more features to this, such as:

- [ ] 100% Test Coverage
- [ ] Detailed Logging
- [ ] Error Handling
- [ ] Rules Engine 
- [ ] GUI/TUI
- [ ] Single player games
- [ ] Multiplayer games
  - [ ] Pass and play
  - [ ] LAN
  - [ ] Bluetooth
- [ ] More games
